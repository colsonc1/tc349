				<p>Before today I knew nothing about the Card Sorting ideology. This process is
				useful when organizing a website that contains a lot of info that needs to be 
				displayed. Though information can be organized in many different ways, Card Sorting 
				allows for someone to come up with the most efficient grouping. Websites should be 
				easy to navigate, easily finding what you are looking for. When doing this assignment 
				I read that you wanted us to have 3 others do the Card Sort. I now see why this is 
				important because it will enhance the usability because of the thought process of 
				others. You must ask yourself if the structure of the navigation of the site is efficient.
				It seemed that my results were different from others. Others put certain cards from "News
				& Events" in the "About The Moon" group. Besides those small differences there were no 
				big changes.</p>
